# Statistical Pitch: The Burden of California's Rising Education Costs
## Story Summary 
In recent decades, American universities have witnessed a steady surge in their tuition fees, rendering them increasingly unaffordable for aspiring students. The average expenses across all universities saw a substantial increase from 2013 to 2023, far outpacing the growth in financial aid availability. Consequently, the soaring costs of attendance have reached a point where they appear unrealistic when compared to the annual household income in California, as evident from the data.

Despite the median annual household income and financial aid seeing some improvement, the expanding affordability gap has left numerous students burdened with overwhelming student loan debts. In order to preserve accessibility to knowledge for countless individuals, policymakers and educators must take prompt and decisive action to ensure that higher education remains within reach for all and does not become an unattainable aspiration.
